# ThermoelectricMCP Server

A tool to predict supercondutor related properties and screen promising supercondutors.

##Overview

This MCP server could make predictions of supercondutor critical temperature. Moreover, this tool could also randomly generate structures with calypso (element-guided) and CrystalFormer (property-guided), then select on-hull structures to further with desire critical temparture
