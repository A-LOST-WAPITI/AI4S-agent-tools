# ThermoelectricMCP Server

A tool to predict thermoelectric material related properties and screen promising thermoelectric materials.

##Overview

This MCP server could make predictions of thermoelectric material related properties, including hse-functional bandgap, power factor, Seeback coefficient, mass of carrier, shear and bulk modulus. Moreover, this tool could also randomly generate structures with calypso (element-guided) and CrystalFormer (property-guided), then select on-hull structures to further thermoelectric performance evaluations via band gap < 0.5eV, space group number > 75, and smaller sound velocity.
