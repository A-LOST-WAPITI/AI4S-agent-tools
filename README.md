# **AI4S-agent-tools**

An open project initiated by the DeepModeling community focused on collecting agentic tools  for scientific research.

We will collaboratively adapt and integrate a suite of "Agent-Ready tool modules" tailored for scientific research scenarios, building a dynamic "scientific capability library" that can be invoked by intelligent agents. These tools cover key tasks in AI for Science, including but not limited to:

- 📘 Multimodal literature parsing (structured extraction of text, figures, and formulas)
  - [arxiv_paper_search](servers/paper_search_demo_mcp_server.py) Demo for the beginners. Contain searching arxiv id relevant to certain topic, and retieving the information of a given arixv-ID.
  
- 🔍 Domain-specific database querying (e.g., materials, drug discovery databases)

- ⚛️ Structure–property relationship modeling for materials and molecules
  - [dpa server](servers/dpa_mcp_server.py) Include building atomic structures, optimizing them using ML interatomic potentials, and analyzing their vibrational properties,
all in a standardized format compatible with AI agent orchestration.

- 🧠 Invocation of AI4S foundation models, such as universal interatomic potentials

- 🧬 Generation, modification, and modeling of molecular and crystal structures

- 🔭 3D visualization and rendering, including orbital and charge density displays

- 📈 Spectral prediction and experimental data analysis (e.g., SEM, XRD, NMR, Raman)

- 🧫 Experimental design and multi-objective optimization (e.g., Bayesian optimization, reinforcement learning)
